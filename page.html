                <p>It is my pleasure to congratulate the team that has taken the initiative for producing this magazine. It is great to ﬁnd a considerable number of articles, poems and drawings that certainly prove that our staff and students are adequately equipped and possess Necessary skill sets to express their talent.
                    Reading this magazine would deﬁnitely be an inspiration and motivation for all students and staff to contribute even more to the forthcoming issues.
                    I hope that everyone would continue to give their full efforts to keep the momentum and continue to enhance the standards of the magazine.

                    I hope that this would be an ongoing process and the magazine would bring out the latent talent of every- one. I join others in appreciating and recognizing the hard work of the editors and the magazine committee in bringing out the magazine and in wishing them suc- cess in their endeavour.
